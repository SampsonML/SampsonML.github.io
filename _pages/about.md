Hey, I'm Matt, a PhD researcher at Princeton University working with [Prof. Peter Melchior](https://pmelchior.net/). I studying ways to advance science and machine learning with a particular focus on modelling dynamical systems, representation learning, optimization, and world models. Previously I was at the Australian National University where I performed numerical experiments and helped develop a code to simulate cosmic ray propagation through a dynamically evolving turbulent plasma. 

> **Long-term vision**:  To create models that deeply understand complex dynamical systems— enabling new discoveries and forming the foundations for increasingly general, physics-inspired intelligence.
