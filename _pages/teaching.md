> **Teaching philosophy**: I believe that education is one of the most important and impactful components of oneâ€™s life, and a high quality education should be available to all regardless of background. I have experience teaching the following units at Princeton University and the Queensland University of Technology where my role ranged from the delivery of lectures, leading tutorials, grading work, and engaging students with new content such as programming languages and higher level statistics for the first time.

Courses I have taught at Princeton and the Queensland University of Technology include
* AST205 Planets and the Universe
* SEB104 Grand Challenges in Science
* SEB113 Quantatative Analysis
* PVB101 Physics of the Very Large
* BVB204 Ecology - Statistics Component
