> **Teaching philosophy**: I believe that education is one of the most important and impactful components of oneâ€™s life, and a high quality education should be available to all regardless of background. With the rapid advancement of technology and the rising potential for great amounts of wealth inquality, it is crucial to emphasise equity in access to quality education.
