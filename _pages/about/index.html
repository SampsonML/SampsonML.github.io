I am formally trained as a physicist, and applied mathematician and am fascinated by the intersection of physics and machine learning. Previously I was at the Australian National University where I performed numerical experiments and helped develop a code to simulate cosmic ray propagation through a dynamically evolving turbulent plasma. I have also worked as a data scientist/computational statistician in fields of information geometry and biology.</p> </body></html>
